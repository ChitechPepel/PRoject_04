<h4 class= "head">Good</div>

<p class ="para"> I like Assassins Creed because it's exciting and gets my adrenaline up.I like how you have a story mode and get to go back to the very old times; when people used swords and ate with their hands.Also I like Assassin's Creed because I like the  environment and story, the feeling of being a awesome assassin moving through the story and Is it just a combination of environment and story, the feeling of being a awesome assassin moving through the story.I think it's original,captivating and it draws you in. The graphics are just as good and the  game play at times is challenging but most of the time its just fun; stabbing numerous guards in one awesome combo. </div>


<h4 class ="head">Bad<div>

<p class="para"> Ezio family is killed in the game so he revenges their death by tracing down his family's killer and the one's that set them up to be killed.So Ezio has to become a assassin and train to kill his family's killer and to stop a conspiracy of very powerful man.

<h4 class="head">Verdict</div> 

<p class="para"> The game play is not  challenging . At first I thought climbing the city was fun until I realized I was just holding down two buttons and moving in a direction I chose. It looks cool, but I'm not doing any of it, just holding down two buttons. I have the game  Hit man where you use disguises, place traps, hide bodies, and plan out the perfect kill, in Assassin's Creed you just jump down behind the temple man and stab them. Most of them can't climb so if you get caught, you can just run a wall hide and wait for the alert meter to go down and try again.</p></div>
