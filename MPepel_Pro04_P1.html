<h4 class= "head">Good</div>

<p class ="para"> Call of Duty ghosts is a refreshing installment to the already brilliant series. It's new type of action and  twists of new level types make an already great game even better. There is a few levels in space and underwater level and a new character. A dog named Riley, unfortunately there is not that may levels with this new awesome character, but the game make up for it with the story. The story is about a named solider who you sacrificed his life to save others and of course he lived and wants revenge. He is hunting you and you are hunting him.

<h4 class ="head">Bad<div>

<p class="para"> Call of duty Ghosts does in fact have some issues though. The multiplayer is probably one of the worst in the series. The maps are way to big and there are not enough players to make these giant maps fun. There were times when I was running around the map for minutes without running into one single player. And the amount of recoil on the weapons make it even worse.</p></div>


<h4 class="head">Verdict</div> 

<p class="para"> I give this game a final 6 out of 10. Just because that the multiplayer needs improvement. And along with some other issues as well.</p></div>
